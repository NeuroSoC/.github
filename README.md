The overarching objective of NeuroSoC is to develop a flexible computing system where an analog IMC-based neural processing unit is integrated into a multi-processor functional safe and secure system-on-chip to tackle the requirements of a wide set of edge-AI applications.

The NeuroSoC approach relying on a solid, mature, and qualified reliable Phase Change Memory technology, will enable to create an industrially proven path to go past the state of the art, answering to the level of maturity need which is compatible with a mass volume production and cost.

The NeuroSoC project is funded under Horizon Europe Grant Agreement nÂ° 101070634, and is as well funded by UKRI and Switzerland.
